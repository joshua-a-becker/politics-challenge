# Politics Challenge
This repository contains the source code for the experimental platform for Experiment 2 in the paper "The Wisdom of Partisan Crowds" published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences:  https://www.pnas.org/content/116/22/10717

## Two Important Notes
1.  The latest commit to this GitHub repository was pushed approximately 1-2 weeks before data collection actually began. Due to an unfortunate incident involving server deletion (I accidentally deleted the cloud server), I do not actually have the final source code used to run the experiment.  It's possible minor changes were made in the intervening weeks.  These would most likely have been bug fixes to form handling.  All published material represents the actual Meteor app used for data collection, and this GitHub repo represents the most recent extant source code for that app. So, it's basically the same, but may have bugs.
2.  This system uses a beta version of the Empirica app and relies on a customized Empirica core, not available in this repo.  That custom code powers the countdown timer in the Intro steps (contact me for usage instructions).  So, this won't just run out-of-the-box.

## Usage
1. Ensure Empirica is working on your system
2. `git clone https://github.com/joshua-a-becker/politics-challenge.git`
3. `meteor npm install`
4. `meteor`
